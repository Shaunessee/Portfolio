# Portfolio
This project was created to be linked to my fully responsive website shaunesseegreen.com. 
It is used as my online portfolio that contains an about me, skills, and project section as well as allows for my resume to be downloaded. 
This project showcases my skills using HTML, CSS/SASS, and UX/UI design.

Project 1: Spacestagram
This project was created using NASA's image api to create an instagram-like layout that displays the title, date and image along with a heart to like or unlike the image.
Creating spacestagram has sallowed me to dive deeper into javascript, teaching me how to fetch api's and manipulate the data. 
One of the hardest components of this project was figuring out how to display all the information for one image on a single card, which was solved using an array.
